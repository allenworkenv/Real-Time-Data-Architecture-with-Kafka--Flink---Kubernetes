# Project Description

This project showcases a local deployment using **Kubernetes with Minikube** to simulate a microservices-based architecture.
The environment is structured to demonstrate how various components, such as API gateways, Kafka clusters, and Flink consumers, can be orchestrated to work together for real-time data processing.
